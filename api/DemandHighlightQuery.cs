// Type Demand & Risk Stars preserves this upstream 1.x client contract and its slot/class names.
// Install provider mod wrt_type_demand_stars; results are shop queries, not the global permanent-star registry.
// Type Demand & Risk Stars's query API, for other mods: find the items of the shop that match an Item Filter expression,
// such as  type:(food or medical) not stolen  , without the highlight or the filter window.
//
// Copy this file into your mod. It needs no reference to Type Demand & Risk Stars, and works the same whether or not
// Type Demand & Risk Stars is installed: without it (or with a version whose contract this file does not know), every call
// says NotInstalled and nothing else happens.
//
//   var found = new List<GameItem>();
//   var r = DemandHighlightQuery.Run("type:(food or medical) not stolen", found);
//   if (r.Ok) Debug.Log("[MyMod] " + r.Count + " items: " + r.Text);
//   else if (r.Status == DemandHighlightQuery.Status.Invalid) Debug.Log("[MyMod] at " + r.Position + ": " + r.Message);
//
// Rules, from Type Demand & Risk Stars's side:
//   - Call from the game's main thread (Unity's), as any game code. Another thread gets WrongThread.
//   - Items belong to the shop. Use them while it is loaded and let them go when the scene changes: keeping one
//     keeps the whole store in memory. Run clears your list first; reuse it between calls.
//   - Each Run walks the shop once, closed containers included. Nothing is cached between calls, so run it when you
//     need an answer, not every frame.
//   - The language is the Item Filter's (Type Demand & Risk Stars's manual, "Filter language"). Type names are read in the
//     player's language too, so prefer identifiers (type:FOOD) in code; Field and Quote below build terms safely.
//
// How it works: Type Demand & Risk Stars puts two delegates and a version string in slots of the AppDomain, which every
// mod's assembly shares, when it is enabled, and takes them out when it is disabled. This file reads them on each
// call. Contract 1.x: a result row is object[] { int status, int count, string problem, string detail,
// int position, int length, string message, string text }; later minor versions only add fields at the end.
